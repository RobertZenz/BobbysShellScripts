Bobbys Shell Scripts
====================

This is a collection of useful, and not so useful, shell scripts for Linux
and similar UNIX systems.

I'll try to make sure that they work under a generic shell, however, from time
to time it might be necessary to resort to Bash features. I will try to make
that clear in the shebang line.
